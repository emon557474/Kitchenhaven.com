## How to Cook Frozen Burritos in an Air Fryer

Cooking a frozen burrito in an air fryer is incredibly simple, and with the right technique, you can achieve perfect results every time. Follow these easy steps:

### Step 1: Preheat the Air Fryer
Preheating the air fryer ensures that the burrito cooks evenly from the start. Set the air fryer to 375°F (190°C) and let it preheat for about 3-5 minutes.

### Step 2: Prepare the Burrito
While the air fryer is preheating, remove your frozen burrito from its packaging. You don’t need to defrost it beforehand – it can go straight from the freezer to the air fryer.

### Step 3: Place the Burrito in the Air Fryer Basket
Place the frozen burrito in the air fryer basket. It's important not to overcrowd the basket to ensure proper airflow and even cooking. If you’re cooking more than one burrito, ensure they have some space between them.

### Step 4: Cook the Burrito
Set the timer for 12-15 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of your burrito. Halfway through the cooking process, flip the burrito to ensure both sides get crispy and evenly heated.

### Step 5: Check for Doneness
Once the timer goes off, check if the burrito is cooked to your liking. If you prefer it a little crisper, leave it in the air fryer for an additional 2-3 minutes.

### Step 6: Serve and Enjoy!
Carefully remove the burrito from the air fryer and let it cool for a few minutes before cutting into it. Now it’s time to enjoy your perfectly cooked frozen burrito!

## Tips for the Best Air Fryer Frozen Burrito

To make sure your frozen burrito comes out perfectly every time, consider these helpful tips:

- **Use Aluminum Foil**: If you want an even crispier texture, wrap your burrito in a small piece of aluminum foil. This will help keep the outside crisp while preventing it from overcooking.
- **Check the Burrito’s Filling**: Make sure the inside of the burrito reaches a safe temperature (165°F or 74°C) before eating. If it feels too cold, pop it back into the air fryer for a couple more minutes.
- **Experiment with Time**: If you find your burrito is not as crispy as you’d like, increase the cooking time by a few minutes. If it’s too crispy, reduce the time slightly.
