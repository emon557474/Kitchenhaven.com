## How to Cook Frozen Egg Rolls in an Air Fryer: Step-by-Step Guide

Ready to make perfectly crispy **air fryer egg rolls**? Follow this simple step-by-step guide to achieve golden perfection every time.

### Step 1: Preheat Your Air Fryer
Most air fryers perform best when preheated. Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and let it warm up for 3-5 minutes. Preheating ensures even cooking and maximum crispiness for your **frozen egg rolls in an air fryer**.

### Step 2: Prepare the Egg Rolls
- **No Thawing Needed**: One of the best things about **cooking frozen egg rolls** is that they go straight from the freezer to the air fryer—no thawing required.
- **Light Oil Spray (Optional)**: For extra crispiness, lightly spray or brush the egg rolls with cooking oil (like vegetable or avocado oil). This step is optional, as many frozen egg rolls already contain enough oil to crisp up.
- **Arrange Evenly**: Place the egg rolls in a single layer in the air fryer basket, ensuring they don’t overlap. Overcrowding can lead to uneven cooking.

### Step 3: Cook the Egg Rolls
- **Set the Time and Temperature**: Cook **frozen egg rolls in an air fryer** at 400°F (200°C) for 8-12 minutes, depending on their size and your air fryer model.
- **Flip Halfway Through**: About halfway through cooking (around 4-6 minutes), shake the basket or flip the egg rolls with tongs to ensure even browning.
- **Check for Doneness**: The egg rolls should be golden brown and crispy. If needed, add 1-2 minutes to the cooking time.

### Step 4: Serve and Enjoy
Remove the egg rolls from the air fryer and let them cool for 1-2 minutes. Serve with dipping sauces like soy sauce, sweet chili sauce, or duck sauce for a burst of flavor.

## Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Egg Rolls Every Time

To elevate your **air fryer egg rolls** game, keep these pro tips in mind:

- **Don’t Overcrowd the Basket**: Cooking in batches ensures each egg roll gets enough hot air circulation for maximum crispiness.
- **Experiment with Temperature**: If your egg rolls aren’t crispy enough, try increasing the temperature to 410°F for the last 1-2 minutes.
- **Check Your Air Fryer’s Manual**: Different models (like Ninja, Cosori, or Philips) may have slightly different cooking times and temperatures.
- **Add Flavor**: Brush egg rolls with a mix of sesame oil and soy sauce before cooking for an extra flavor boost.
