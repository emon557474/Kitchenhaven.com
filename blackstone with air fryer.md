## How to Use the Blackstone Griddle with an Air Fryer

### 1. **Preheat the Appliances**
Before you start cooking, preheat both the Blackstone griddle and the air fryer. For the griddle, preheat it to medium-high heat, and for the air fryer, set it to the desired temperature (usually around 375°F or 190°C).

### 2. **Use the Blackstone Griddle for Cooking Protein**
The Blackstone griddle is ideal for cooking proteins like chicken, steak, and fish. Simply season your protein, place it on the preheated griddle, and cook to your desired level of doneness. The griddle provides a large cooking surface and even heat distribution for perfect searing.

### 3. **Use the Air Fryer for Crispy Sides**
Once your protein is cooking on the griddle, you can focus on preparing crispy sides in the air fryer. Frozen French fries, tater tots, chicken wings, or even vegetables can be cooked to perfection in the air fryer.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frozen Fries or Tots:</strong> Toss your frozen fries or tater tots in a little olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and cook at 400°F (200°C) for about 15-20 minutes for crispy results.</li>
  <li><strong>Chicken Wings:</strong> For crispy wings, cook them in the air fryer at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, shaking halfway through for even cooking.</li>
  <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Use the air fryer to cook vegetables like zucchini, carrots, or broccoli at 375°F (190°C) for about 10-15 minutes for a healthy, crispy side.</li>
</ul>

### 4. **Combine for a Complete Meal**
Once your protein and sides are ready, combine them on the plate. Serve a juicy steak or chicken from the griddle with crispy fries, wings, or veggies from the air fryer. You’ve just created a meal that’s both flavorful and well-balanced!

## Tips for Perfect Results with the Blackstone and Air Fryer Combo

<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd:</strong> Both the Blackstone griddle and the air fryer work best when the food is spaced out. For the griddle, give your food enough room to sear properly. In the air fryer, avoid overcrowding the basket to ensure the food crisps up evenly.</li>
  <li><strong>Use the Right Temperature:</strong> The Blackstone griddle can reach high temperatures, perfect for searing proteins. The air fryer, on the other hand, works well at a lower temperature for crispy sides. Always check your appliance’s instructions for optimal cooking temperatures.</li>
  <li><strong>Season and Marinate:</strong> Both appliances cook food to perfection, but adding marinades, rubs, or seasonings will elevate the flavors. Don’t skip the seasoning for your meats and sides!</li>
  <li><strong>Keep it Clean:</strong> Both the Blackstone and the air fryer are easy to clean, but don’t forget to wipe down the griddle after use and clean the air fryer basket to keep them in great working condition.</li>
</ul>
