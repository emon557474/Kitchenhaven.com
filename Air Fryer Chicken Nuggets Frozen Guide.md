### Step 1: Choose Your Nuggets
Not all frozen chicken nuggets are created equal. Some top brands recommended by chefs and home cooks include:

- **Just Bare Lightly Breaded Chicken Breast Bites**: Known for their Chick-fil-A-like flavor, these are widely available and come with air fryer instructions.[](https://www.allrecipes.com/chefs-favorite-frozen-chicken-nuggets-8776078)

You can also opt for **vegan chicken nuggets air fryer** options, like Impossible Nuggets, for a plant-based twist.[](https://sporked.com/article/best-frozen-chicken-nuggets/)

### Step 2: Preheat Your Air Fryer
Preheating your air fryer to **400°F (204°C)** ensures even cooking and maximum crispiness. Most air fryers take about 3-5 minutes to preheat. If your model doesn’t require preheating, you can skip this step.[](https://myminichefs.com/air-fryer-frozen-chicken-nuggets/)

### Step 3: Arrange the Nuggets
Place the **frozen chicken nuggets** in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to allow hot air to circulate freely, which is key to achieving that **crispy chicken nuggets air fryer** texture. If you’re cooking a large batch, work in batches to maintain quality.[](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-make-super-easy-air-fryer-chicken-nuggets/)

### Step 4: Cook and Flip
Set the air fryer to **400°F** and cook for **8-12 minutes**, depending on the size and brand of the nuggets. For even cooking:

- **Shake or Flip**: Halfway through (around 4-6 minutes), shake the basket or flip the nuggets with tongs to ensure all sides crisp up evenly.[](https://40aprons.com/air-fryer-frozen-chicken-nuggets/)
- **Check Internal Temperature**: Use an instant-read thermometer to confirm the nuggets reach an internal temperature of **165°F** for safety.[](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/frozen-chicken-nuggets-mistake/)

### Step 5: Serve and Enjoy
Remove the nuggets and let them cool for 2-3 minutes. Serve with your favorite dipping sauces like ketchup, honey mustard, or a spicy sriracha-mayo blend. Pair with **air fryer frozen fries** or a side salad for a complete meal.[](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-make-super-easy-air-fryer-chicken-nuggets/)
