- **Peeling**: Use a sturdy vegetable peeler to remove the tough outer skin. If the squash is too hard, microwave it for 2-3 minutes to soften slightly.
- **Cutting**: Slice off the top and bottom, cut the squash in half, and scoop out the seeds. Then, chop into 1-inch cubes or wedges for even cooking.

### Step 3: Season
Toss the squash with olive oil, salt, pepper, and your favorite seasonings. Popular choices include:
- Garlic powder
- Smoked paprika
- Cinnamon (for a sweet twist)
- Rosemary or thyme (for savory dishes)

### Step 4: Preheat the Air Fryer
Set your air fryer to 375°F (190°C) and let it preheat for 3-5 minutes. Preheating ensures even cooking and crispiness.

For the best results, consider investing in a high-quality air fryer.
