## How to Cook Air Fryer Frozen Chicken Nuggets Perfectly

Cooking frozen chicken nuggets in an air fryer is incredibly simple, but a few tips can elevate your results. Follow these steps to ensure your nuggets come out crispy and delicious every time.

### Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions

1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set your air fryer to 400°F (204°C). Preheating ensures even cooking and maximum crispiness. If your air fryer doesn’t require preheating, skip this step.
2. **Arrange the Nuggets**: Place frozen chicken nuggets in a single layer in the air fryer basket or on the wire rack. Avoid overcrowding to allow hot air to circulate freely.
3. **Cook Time**: Air fry for 8-12 minutes, depending on the nugget size and brand. Shake the basket or flip the nuggets halfway through for even crisping.
4. **Check Doneness**: Use an instant-read thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) for food safety.
5. **Serve Immediately**: Enjoy your nuggets hot with your favorite dipping sauces like ketchup, ranch, or honey mustard.

### Tips for Extra Crispy Nuggets

- **Don’t Overcrowd**: Space out the nuggets to avoid steaming.
- **Light Oil Spray**: For extra crispiness, lightly spray the nuggets with olive oil or cooking spray before cooking (optional).
- **Shake or Flip**: Halfway through, shake the basket or flip the nuggets to ensure all sides crisp evenly.
- **Adjust for Size**: Smaller nuggets may cook faster (6-8 minutes), while larger ones may need 10-12 minutes.

## Best Air Fryers for Cooking Frozen Chicken Nuggets

Not all air fryers are created equal. For the best results with frozen chicken nuggets, choose a model with good heat circulation and enough capacity for your needs. Here are some top picks:

- **Compact Air Fryer**: Ideal for small households or dorms, like the Dash Compact Air Fryer, which cooks nuggets in under 10 minutes.
- **Basket-Style Air Fryer**: Models like the Cosori or Ninja are great for families, fitting up to 14 nuggets in a single layer.
