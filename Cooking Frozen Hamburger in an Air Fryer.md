## Choosing the Right Frozen Hamburger Patties

Before diving into the cooking process, let’s talk about selecting the best frozen hamburger patties for your air fryer. The quality of your patties will significantly impact the flavor and texture of your burgers.

### What to Look for in Frozen Patties

- **Ingredients**: Opt for patties with minimal additives and high-quality beef. Look for 80/20 ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat) for the best balance of flavor and juiciness.
- **Thickness**: Patties that are ¼ to ½ inch thick cook evenly in an air fryer. Thicker patties may require longer cooking times.
- **Seasoning**: Some frozen patties come pre-seasoned, while others are plain. Choose based on your flavor preferences or customize plain patties with your own spices.
- **Brand Quality**: Popular brands like Bubba Burger, Omaha Steaks, or ButcherBox offer high-quality frozen patties that work well in air fryers.

## How to Cook Frozen Hamburger in an Air Fryer: Step-by-Step Guide

Now that you’ve chosen your patties, let’s get to the main event: **cooking frozen hamburger in an air fryer**. Follow these simple steps for perfect burgers every time.

### Step 1: Preheat Your Air Fryer

Most air fryers benefit from preheating, which ensures even cooking. Set your air fryer to 375°F (190°C) and let it preheat for 3-5 minutes. If your air fryer doesn’t have a preheat function, simply run it empty for a few minutes at the desired temperature.

### Step 2: Prepare the Patties

There’s no need to thaw frozen hamburger patties before cooking them in an air fryer. However, you can enhance the flavor with a few simple tweaks:

1. **Seasoning**: If your patties are unseasoned, sprinkle both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, or your favorite burger seasoning.
2. **Oil (Optional)**: Lightly brush the patties with olive oil or avocado oil to enhance crispiness and prevent sticking.
3. **Parchment Paper**: Place a piece of parchment paper or an air fryer liner in the basket to make cleanup easier.

### Step 3: Arrange the Patties

Place the frozen patties in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to ensure proper air circulation. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook in batches.

### Step 4: Cook the Burgers

Set the air fryer to 375°F (190°C) and cook the patties for 10-14 minutes, flipping them halfway through. Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the patties and the model of your air fryer. Here’s a quick guide to doneness:

- **Medium-Rare (135°F)**: 10-11 minutes
- **Medium (140°F)**: 11-12 minutes
- **Medium-Well (150°F)**: 12-13 minutes
- **Well-Done (160°F)**: 13-14 minutes

Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature for accuracy.

### Step 5: Add Cheese (Optional)

If you’re making cheeseburgers, add a slice of cheese to each patty during the last 1-2 minutes of cooking. The residual heat will melt the cheese perfectly.

### Step 6: Assemble Your Burger

Once cooked, remove the patties from the air fryer and let them rest for 1-2 minutes. Serve on toasted buns with your favorite toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, or mayo.
