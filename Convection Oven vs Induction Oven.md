## <h2>Cooking Method</h2>

### <h3>Convection Oven</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uses a fan:</strong> Circulates hot air evenly, leading to consistent cooking.</li>
<li><strong>Faster cooking:</strong> Reduces cooking time by around 25% compared to conventional ovens.</li>
<li><strong>Better browning:</strong> Ideal for baking and roasting.</li>
</ul>

### <h3>Induction Oven</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uses electromagnetic energy:</strong> Heats cookware directly without heating the air.</li>
<li><strong>Instant heat:</strong> Rapid temperature adjustments for precision cooking.</li>
<li><strong>Even heating:</strong> No hot or cold spots.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Convection Oven:</strong> More energy-efficient than traditional ovens but still loses some heat.</li>
<li><strong>Induction Oven:</strong> Highly efficient, as energy is directly transferred to cookware.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Cooking Performance</h2>

### <h3>Convection Oven</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great for roasting meats and baking pastries.</li>
<li>Provides crispy textures and uniform cooking.</li>
<li>Requires adjusting cooking times for some recipes.</li>
</ul>

### <h3>Induction Oven</h3>
<ul>
<li>Perfect for precision cooking and simmering.</li>
<li>Heats and cools instantly.</li>
<li>Requires compatible cookware (magnetic-based materials like cast iron or stainless steel).</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Safety</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Convection Oven:</strong> Exterior remains hot, requiring caution.</li>
<li><strong>Induction Oven:</strong> Stays cool to the touch unless cookware is present.</li>
</ul>
