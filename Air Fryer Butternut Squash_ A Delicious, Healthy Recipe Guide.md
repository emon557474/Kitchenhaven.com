## How to Prepare Butternut Squash for the Air Fryer

Before you start cooking, proper preparation is key to achieving the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide to prepping butternut squash for your air fryer:

### Step 1: Choose the Right Squash
Look for a butternut squash that is firm, heavy for its size, and free of soft spots or cracks. A medium-sized squash (about 2–3 pounds) is ideal for most air fryer recipes.

### Step 2: Peel and Cube
- **Peeling**: Use a sturdy vegetable peeler to remove the tough skin. Alternatively, microwave the squash for 2–3 minutes to soften it slightly for easier peeling.
- **Cutting**: Slice off the top and bottom, then cut the squash in half where the bulbous end meets the neck. Scoop out the seeds from the bulbous end and cube the flesh into 1-inch pieces for even cooking.

### Step 3: Season
Toss the cubes with a drizzle of olive oil and your favorite seasonings. Popular choices include:
- Salt and pepper
- Garlic powder
- Paprika or smoked paprika
- Cinnamon or nutmeg for a sweet twist
- Fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme

### Step 4: Preheat the Air Fryer
Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and let it preheat for 3–5 minutes. This ensures even cooking and a crispy exterior.

If you don’t yet own an air fryer, now’s the perfect time to invest in one to make recipes like this a breeze.
