## How to Cook Frozen Air Fryer Corn Dogs

Cooking frozen corn dogs in an air fryer is as easy as it gets. Follow these steps for crispy, golden results every time:

1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set your air fryer to 360°F (182°C). Preheating ensures even cooking.
2. **Arrange the Corn Dogs**: Place frozen corn dogs in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to allow proper air circulation.
3. **Spray Lightly**: Mist the corn dogs with a thin layer of olive or avocado oil spray for extra crispiness.
4. **Cook**: Air fry for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through. Cooking times may vary depending on your air fryer model, so check for a golden-brown exterior.
5. **Cool and Serve**: Let the corn dogs cool for 1-2 minutes to avoid burning your mouth. Serve with ketchup, mustard, or your favorite dipping sauce.

## Homemade Air Fryer Corn Dogs Recipe

Want to take your corn dogs to the next level? Making them from scratch is fun, customizable, and surprisingly simple. Here’s a foolproof recipe for homemade air fryer corn dogs.

### Ingredients (Makes 8 Corn Dogs)
- 8 hot dogs (pork, beef, or plant-based)
- 1 cup cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup milk
- 8 wooden skewers
- Cooking oil spray

### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Hot Dogs**: Pat the hot dogs dry with a paper towel to help the batter stick. Insert a wooden skewer into each hot dog, leaving enough stick for a handle.
2. **Make the Batter**: In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, mix the egg and milk. Combine wet and dry ingredients, stirring until smooth. The batter should be thick but pourable.
3. **Coat the Hot Dogs**: Pour the batter into a tall glass for easy dipping. Dip each hot dog into the batter, ensuring it’s fully coated. Let excess batter drip off.
4. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set to 370°F (188°C).
5. **Cook**: Place 3-4 corn dogs in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Lightly spray with oil. Cook for 10-12 minutes, turning halfway, until golden and crispy.
6. **Serve**: Let cool slightly and serve with dipping sauces like honey mustard or ranch.

**Note**: Homemade corn dogs may require slight adjustments in cooking time based on batter thickness and air fryer model.
