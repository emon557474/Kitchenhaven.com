- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper (optional)
- Optional: 1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey for extra sweetness

### Instructions
1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set your air fryer to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C) for 3-5 minutes to ensure even cooking.[](https://hellofrozenbananas.com/air-fryer-acorn-squash/)
