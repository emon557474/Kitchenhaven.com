### What You’ll Need
- Frozen chicken tenders (breaded or unbreaded)
- Air fryer
- Tongs for flipping
- Optional: Cooking spray, seasonings, or dipping sauces

### Instructions
1. **Preheat the Air Fryer (Optional)**: Some air fryers don’t require preheating, but if yours does, set it to 400°F (204°C) for 3–5 minutes.
2. **Arrange the Tenders**: Place frozen chicken tenders in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overlapping for the best results.
3. **Set the Temperature and Time**: Cook at 360°F–400°F (182°C–204°C) for 10–15 minutes, depending on the tender type.
4. **Flip Halfway**: At the halfway mark (around 5–7 minutes), use tongs to flip the tenders for even browning.
5. **Check Doneness**: Use a meat thermometer to confirm the internal temperature is at least 165°F (74°C).
6. **Serve**: Let the tenders rest for 1–2 minutes before serving with your favorite dipping sauces like ranch, BBQ, or honey mustard.

### Tips for Extra Crispy Tenders
- **Light Oil Spray**: Lightly spray the tenders with cooking oil before air frying to enhance crispiness.
- **Shake the Basket**: Gently shake the basket during cooking to promote even air circulation.
- **Avoid Overcrowding**: Cook in batches if needed to prevent steaming instead of crisping.

## Factors That Affect Cooking Time

Several factors can influence **how long to cook frozen chicken strips in air fryer**. Understanding these can help you adjust for perfect results.

### Air Fryer Model
Different air fryer models have varying wattage and air circulation patterns. Basket-style air fryers may cook slightly faster than oven-style models. Check your air fryer’s manual for specific guidance.

### Size and Thickness of Tenders
Larger or thicker tenders take longer to cook. For example, **air fryer chicken nuggets** (smaller pieces) may cook in 8–10 minutes, while thicker **frozen chicken strips** need 12–15 minutes.

### Breaded vs. Unbreaded
Breaded tenders cook faster due to their coating, which crisps up quickly. Unbreaded tenders require a few extra minutes to ensure the interior is fully cooked.

### Frozen vs. Partially Thawed
Cooking straight from frozen is ideal, but if the tenders are partially thawed, reduce the cooking time by 1–2 minutes to avoid overcooking.
