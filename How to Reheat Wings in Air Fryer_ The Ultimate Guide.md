## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Reheat Wings in Air Fryer

Follow these simple steps to reheat your wings to perfection. This method works for refrigerated wings, but we’ll cover frozen wings later too!

### Step 1: Prepare Your Wings
Start by taking your wings out of the fridge. Let them sit at room temperature for about 10-15 minutes. This helps them reheat evenly and prevents the meat from getting tough. If your wings are saucy (like buffalo or BBQ), no need to wipe off the sauce—it’ll caramelize beautifully in the air fryer!

### Step 2: Preheat the Air Fryer
Set your air fryer to 360°F (180°C). Preheating takes just 2-3 minutes for most models and ensures consistent cooking. If your air fryer doesn’t have a preheat setting, simply run it empty for a couple of minutes.

### Step 3: Arrange the Wings
Place the wings in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Avoid overcrowding—air needs to circulate for that crispy finish. If you have a large batch, reheat in smaller groups. Lightly spray the wings with cooking oil or auto Related Keyword by ai 2 like avocado oil for extra crispiness.

### Step 4: Reheat the Wings
Cook the wings at 360°F for 5-8 minutes. Halfway through, use tongs to flip them for even heating. Check the internal temperature with a thermometer—165°F means they’re safe and ready. If they’re not crispy enough, add 1-2 more minutes.

### Step 5: Rest and Serve
Remove the wings with tongs and let them rest on a plate for 1-2 minutes. This locks in the juices. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce, celery sticks, or just enjoy them as is!

## Reheating Frozen Wings in an Air Fryer

Got frozen wings? No problem! The air fryer can handle those too. Here’s how to reheat wings in air fryer straight from the freezer:

1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set it to 380°F (190°C) for frozen wings, as they need a slightly higher temp.
2. **Arrange the Wings**: Place them in a single layer in the basket—no need to thaw.
3. **Cook Longer**: Air fry for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through.
4. **Check Temperature**: Ensure they reach 165°F internally.
5. **Crisp It Up**: If needed, add 1-2 minutes for extra crunch.

Pro tip: A light spritz of auto Related Keyword by ai 3 like canola oil can boost the crisp factor for frozen wings!

## Tips for the Best Reheated Wings

- **Sauce After Reheating**: If adding more sauce, do it after air frying to avoid sogginess.
