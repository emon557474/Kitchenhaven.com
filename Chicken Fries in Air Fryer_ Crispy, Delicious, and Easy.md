## What Are Chicken Fries?

For the uninitiated, chicken fries are long, thin strips of breaded or battered chicken, typically deep-fried for a crispy exterior and juicy interior. Popularized by fast-food chains like Burger King, chicken fries are now a favorite for home cooks thanks to air fryers. They’re essentially a cross between chicken nuggets and fries—fun, dippable, and packed with flavor.

When prepared in an air fryer, chicken fries retain that satisfying crunch while staying tender inside. You can use store-bought frozen chicken fries or make your own for a fresher, customizable option. Let’s break down both methods.
