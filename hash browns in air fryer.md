## Ingredients for Air Fryer Hash Browns

To make hash browns in the air fryer, you'll need the following ingredients:

<ul>
  <li>Frozen hash browns (or fresh grated potatoes if you're making from scratch)</li>
  <li>Olive oil spray (optional for extra crispiness)</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>Optional seasonings: garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or fresh herbs (like parsley or thyme)</li>
</ul>

## How to Make Hash Browns in an Air Fryer: Step-by-Step

### 1. Preheat the Air Fryer
Preheating your air fryer is essential to achieving that perfect crispy texture. Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and let it heat for about 5 minutes.

### 2. Prepare the Hash Browns
If you're using frozen hash browns, there's no need to thaw them. For fresh potatoes, grate them using a box grater or food processor, then squeeze out any excess moisture with a clean kitchen towel.

- **Frozen Hash Browns:** Simply take them out of the bag and season them with salt, pepper, and any other spices you like.
- **Fresh Potatoes:** Mix the grated potatoes with a little olive oil, salt, pepper, and optional seasonings like garlic powder or paprika. Form them into patties or spread them out in an even layer.

### 3. Spray with Olive Oil (Optional)
Lightly spray the hash browns with olive oil to help them crisp up. This step is optional, but it will give them a golden-brown exterior.

### 4. Air Fry the Hash Browns
Place the hash browns in the air fryer basket. Make sure they are spread out evenly without overlapping to ensure even cooking.

- **For Frozen Hash Browns**: Cook at 400°F (200°C) for about 10-12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.
- **For Fresh Hash Browns**: If you’ve formed them into patties, cook them for about 10-15 minutes at 400°F (200°C), flipping halfway through. If you’ve spread them in a thin layer, cook for 8-10 minutes.

Check for crispiness and cook a little longer if you want them extra crispy.

### 5. Serve and Enjoy!
Once your hash browns are golden brown and crispy, remove them from the air fryer. Serve them immediately with your favorite breakfast dishes like eggs, bacon, or toast.

## Tips for Making Perfect Hash Browns in the Air Fryer

<ul>
  <li><strong>Don't Overcrowd the Basket:</strong> Give the hash browns plenty of space in the air fryer basket to allow air circulation for even cooking.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust Time for Thickness:</strong> If your hash browns are thicker or if you're making large patties, you may need to cook them a few minutes longer.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> If you're worried about the hash browns sticking to the basket, you can use a parchment paper liner designed for air fryers. Just make sure to leave space around the edges for airflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Seasoning Variations:</strong> Experiment with different seasonings like paprika, onion powder, or fresh herbs for extra flavor.</li>
  <li><strong>Frozen Hash Browns vs. Fresh Potatoes:</strong> Both work well, but fresh potatoes may require more time to cook depending on thickness. Frozen hash browns are more convenient and usually cook a little faster.</li>
</ul>
