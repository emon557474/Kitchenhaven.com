- **Optional Parchment Paper**: Air fryer-specific parchment with holes can prevent sticking and make cleanup even easier.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cooking Frozen Hash Brown Patties in an Air Fryer

Here’s a foolproof method to get perfectly crispy **frozen hash brown patties in an air fryer** every time. Follow these steps for golden, restaurant-worthy results.

### Step 1: Preheat Your Air Fryer
Preheating is key to achieving that crispy exterior. Set your air fryer to **400°F (205°C)** for 3-5 minutes. Preheating ensures the patties start cooking immediately, preventing sogginess from thawing. If your air fryer doesn’t have a preheat setting, simply run it empty at the desired temperature for a few minutes.

### Step 2: Prepare the Air Fryer Basket
Lightly spray the air fryer basket with a non-aerosol cooking spray, such as avocado or olive oil, to prevent sticking. Many frozen hash brown patties already contain oil, so this step is optional but can enhance results. Alternatively, use air fryer parchment paper with perforations to allow proper air circulation.

### Step 3: Arrange the Patties
Place the **frozen hash brown patties** in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overlapping or stacking, as this can trap moisture and lead to uneven cooking. Depending on your air fryer’s size, you may need to cook in batches—typically 4-6 patties fit comfortably in a standard basket.

### Step 4: Season (Optional)
For a flavor boost, sprinkle the patties with salt, pepper, garlic powder, or your favorite seasonings before cooking. For a fast-food-style taste, a light spritz of oil and a pinch of salt can mimic McDonald’s hash browns.

### Step 5: Air Fry the Patties
Cook the patties at **400°F (205°C)** for **8-12 minutes**, flipping them halfway through with silicone tongs or a spatula. Flipping ensures both sides get evenly crispy. Check for your desired level of crispiness—add 1-2 minutes for extra crunch if needed.

### Step 6: Cool and Serve
Remove the patties from the air fryer and let them cool for 1-2 minutes. This helps them crisp up further as they rest. Serve immediately with ketchup, hot sauce, or your favorite dip, or pair with eggs, bacon, or sausage for a complete breakfast.
