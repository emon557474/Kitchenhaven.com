## Ingredients for Air Fryer Frozen Chicken Wings

To make frozen chicken wings in the air fryer, you’ll need the following:

<ul>
  <li>Frozen chicken wings (no need to thaw)</li>
  <li>Olive oil spray (optional, for extra crispiness)</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>Your favorite seasoning blend (such as garlic powder, paprika, or onion powder)</li>
  <li>Optional: Hot sauce or buffalo sauce for tossing after cooking</li>
</ul>

## How to Cook Frozen Chicken Wings in an Air Fryer: Step-by-Step

### 1. Preheat the Air Fryer
Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) for about 5 minutes. Preheating ensures that the wings cook evenly and get crispy on the outside.

### 2. Season the Frozen Chicken Wings
While frozen, your chicken wings will still benefit from a little seasoning:

- **Spray the Wings**: Lightly spray the frozen chicken wings with olive oil spray. This step is optional but helps the wings become extra crispy.
- **Season**: Sprinkle salt, pepper, and any other seasoning of your choice. Garlic powder, paprika, and onion powder are great options for flavor.

> **Pro Tip**: You can also toss the wings in your favorite marinade or sauce after cooking for extra flavor.

### 3. Arrange the Wings in the Air Fryer Basket
Place the frozen chicken wings in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Try not to overcrowd the basket to allow air to circulate and cook the wings evenly. If needed, cook in batches.

### 4. Air Fry the Chicken Wings
Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and cook for 20-25 minutes. Shake the basket halfway through the cooking time to ensure even cooking. For extra crispy wings, you can cook them a few minutes longer, checking regularly to avoid overcooking.

> **Pro Tip**: If you prefer extra crispy wings, after the initial cooking time, let the wings sit in the air fryer for an additional 5 minutes.

### 5. Optional: Toss in Sauce
Once the wings are cooked and crispy, you can toss them in your favorite sauce like buffalo sauce, BBQ sauce, or teriyaki sauce for an added kick.

### 6. Serve and Enjoy!
Remove the wings from the air fryer and serve immediately. Enjoy them with a side of veggies, dipping sauce, or as part of a larger meal.

## Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Chicken Wings

<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd:</strong> Ensure the wings are in a single layer in the air fryer basket to allow air to circulate for even cooking. Overcrowding can result in uneven crispiness.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> If your wings are particularly large, they may need a few extra minutes to cook. Use a meat thermometer to check that they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).</li>
  <li><strong>Flip the Wings:</strong> Shaking the basket halfway through or flipping the wings helps ensure both sides get crispy and evenly cooked.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different seasoning blends like Cajun, lemon pepper, or barbecue rubs. The air fryer gives you the perfect crispy texture to complement any flavor profile.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional: Add a Glaze:</strong> Toss the wings in a glaze like honey garlic, BBQ, or buffalo sauce after cooking for a flavorful finish.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Protein-Packed:</strong> Chicken wings are a great source of lean protein, which is essential for muscle repair and overall health.</li>
