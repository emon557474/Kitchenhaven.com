<h2>What is a Keurig?</h2>
<p>A <strong>Keurig</strong> is a single-serve coffee machine that uses pre-packaged coffee pods, known as K-Cups. It’s designed for convenience, speed, and consistency.</p>

<h3>Pros of Keurig:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fast Brewing:</strong> Makes coffee in under a minute.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy to Use:</strong> Just insert a K-Cup, press a button, and enjoy.</li>
    <li><strong>Less Mess:</strong> No need to deal with coffee grounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Variety of Flavors:</strong> Hundreds of K-Cup options available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons of Keurig:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Expensive Over Time:</strong> K-Cups cost more than ground coffee.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Customization:</strong> No control over grind size or brew strength.</li>
    <li><strong>Plastic Waste:</strong> K-Cups generate more waste than traditional brewing methods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a Traditional Coffee Maker?</h2>
<p>A <strong>drip coffee maker</strong> brews coffee by heating water and dripping it through ground coffee into a carafe.</p>

<h3>Pros of Traditional Coffee Makers:</h3>

    <li><strong>More Control:</strong> Choose your coffee grind, strength, and filter type.</li>
    <li><strong>Eco-Friendly:</strong> Uses paper or reusable filters instead of plastic pods.</li>
    <li><strong>Great for Large Batches:</strong> Brews multiple cups at once.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons of Traditional Coffee Makers:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Slower Brew Time:</strong> Takes several minutes to make coffee.</li>
    <li><strong>More Cleanup:</strong> You need to clean the filter and coffee grounds.</li>
