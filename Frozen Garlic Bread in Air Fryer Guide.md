### Equipment
- Air fryer (basket or oven-style)
- Tongs for safe handling
- Optional: Parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy cleanup

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Prepare the Air Fryer**: Preheat your air fryer to 350°F (180°C) for 3-5 minutes if required by your model. Many air fryers, like the Cosori or Ninja, don’t need preheating.
2. **Unwrap the Bread**: Remove the frozen garlic bread from its packaging. If using a baguette, cut it into smaller pieces to fit your air fryer basket.
3. **Arrange in the Basket**: Place the bread in a single layer, ensuring pieces don’t overlap. This allows hot air to circulate evenly for **crispy air fryer garlic bread**.
4. **Cook**: Air fry at 350°F (180°C) for 5-8 minutes, depending on the bread type and desired crispness. Texas toast typically takes 5-6 minutes, while baguette-style may need 7-8 minutes.
5. **Check for Doneness**: Look for golden-brown edges and melted butter. If adding cheese, sprinkle it on during the last 1-2 minutes of cooking.
6. **Serve Immediately**: Use tongs to remove the bread and serve hot with your favorite dishes.

### Cooking Times by Bread Type
- **Texas Toast**: 5-6 minutes at 350°F (180°C)

> **Pro Tip**: Flip Texas toast halfway through cooking for even crispness. Baguette-style bread usually doesn’t need flipping unless topped with cheese.
