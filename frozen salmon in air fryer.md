## Why Cook Frozen Salmon in an Air Fryer?

There are many reasons why cooking frozen salmon in an air fryer is a great idea:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Quick and Easy</strong>: You don’t need to thaw the salmon. Just pop it straight from the freezer into the air fryer, and you're good to go.</li>
  <li><strong>Healthy Option</strong>: Air frying uses little to no oil, which helps retain the nutrients of the salmon while keeping it low in fat.</li>
  <li><strong>Perfectly Cooked Every Time</strong>: The air fryer circulates hot air evenly, so you get a crisp, golden exterior and a tender, juicy interior.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimal Cleanup</strong>: Unlike traditional frying, there’s no grease splatter or messy pans. Simply wipe down your air fryer basket after use!</li>
</ul>

## Ingredients You'll Need

<ul>
  <li>2 frozen salmon fillets (skin-on or skinless)</li>
  <li>Olive oil spray (optional for extra crispness)</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>Optional seasonings: garlic powder, lemon juice, paprika, or herbs like dill or parsley</li>
</ul>

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Cooking Frozen Salmon in an Air Fryer

### 1. Preheat the Air Fryer
Preheating your air fryer ensures that your salmon cooks evenly. Set the air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and let it heat for about 5 minutes.

### 2. Season the Frozen Salmon
<p> 
  <strong>Spray the Fillets:</strong> Lightly spray the frozen salmon fillets with olive oil. This step is optional but will help the fish crisp up. <br>
  <strong>Season:</strong> Sprinkle salt, pepper, and any other seasonings of your choice, like garlic powder, paprika, or a dash of lemon juice. For extra flavor, you can add fresh herbs like dill or parsley on top.
</p>

> **Pro Tip**: The beauty of using frozen salmon is that you don’t need to thaw it, which saves time and effort.

### 3. Place the Salmon in the Air Fryer Basket
Place the seasoned salmon fillets in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Make sure the fillets are not overlapping to ensure even cooking. If you have large fillets, you might need to cook them in batches.

### 4. Air Fry the Salmon
Set the air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and cook for 10-12 minutes. The cooking time may vary based on the thickness of the fillets. Check the salmon after 10 minutes by gently flaking it with a fork. The fish should be opaque and flake easily.

> **Pro Tip**: If you prefer crispy skin, make sure the skin side is facing up during cooking. The air fryer’s circulation will crisp up the skin.

### 5. Optional: Add a Fresh Lemon Slice
Once the salmon is done, you can top it with a fresh slice of lemon for a burst of citrus flavor. This step is optional, but it adds a lovely freshness to the dish.

### 6. Serve and Enjoy!
Remove the salmon from the air fryer and serve it immediately with your favorite side dishes. The crisp skin and tender, flaky flesh make it perfect with a side of roasted vegetables, salad, or rice.

## Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Salmon

<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd:</strong> Make sure the salmon fillets are not overlapping in the basket. Overcrowding can prevent the air from circulating properly, leading to uneven cooking.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> Thicker fillets will require a little more time, so check the salmon at 10 minutes and add extra time if needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> If you want to make cleanup easier, you can line the air fryer basket with a parchment paper liner designed for air fryers.</li>
</ul>

## Health Benefits of Salmon

Salmon is not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients. Here are some of the key health benefits:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids:</strong> Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health and brain function.</li>
  <li><strong>High in Protein:</strong> A great source of protein, salmon helps build and repair muscle tissue.</li>
  <li><strong>Vitamins and Minerals:</strong> Salmon is loaded with vitamins like B12, D, and minerals such as selenium and potassium.</li>
</ul>

Cooking your salmon in the air fryer retains much of these nutrients, making it a healthy meal option.

## Why Choose Frozen Salmon?

Frozen salmon is often just as fresh as its fresh counterpart. It’s frozen shortly after being caught, locking in all the nutrients and flavor. Plus, frozen salmon is convenient and can be stored for longer periods, meaning you can always have a healthy meal option ready whenever you need it.
