- **Tyson Chicken Nuggets**: A classic choice with consistent quality and a variety of shapes, like fun dinosaur nuggets. They’re widely available and cook beautifully in the air fryer.

## How to Cook Frozen Chicken Nuggets in an Air Fryer

Mastering **how to cook frozen nuggets** in the air fryer is simple, but a few key steps ensure perfect results every time. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get that crispy, golden goodness.

### Step 1: Preheat the Air Fryer
Most air fryers benefit from preheating to ensure even cooking. Set your air fryer to **400°F (204°C)** for 2–3 minutes. If your model doesn’t require preheating, skip this step. Preheating helps achieve that **crispy chicken nuggets air fryer** texture right from the start.[](https://www.foodfanatic.com/cooking/how-to/frozen-chicken-nuggets-air-fryer/)

### Step 2: Arrange Nuggets in a Single Layer
Place the frozen chicken nuggets in the air fryer basket or on the wire rack in a **single layer**. Avoid overcrowding, as this prevents proper air circulation and can lead to soggy spots. If you’re cooking a large batch, work in batches to maintain crispiness.

### Step 3: Cook at 400°F for 8–12 Minutes
Cook the nuggets at **400°F** for **8–12 minutes**, depending on their size and your air fryer model. Shake the basket or flip the nuggets halfway through to ensure even browning. For smaller nuggets, check for doneness around 8 minutes. Larger or thicker nuggets may need up to 12 minutes.[](https://airfryerdiaries.com/frozen-chicken-nuggets-air-fryer/)

### Step 4: Check Internal Temperature
For food safety, ensure the nuggets reach an **internal temperature of 165°F**. Use an instant-read thermometer to confirm they’re fully heated through. This is especially important for uncooked or homemade nuggets.[](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/frozen-chicken-nuggets-mistake/)

### Step 5: Let Them Rest
After cooking, let the nuggets rest for 1–2 minutes. This helps lock in the crispiness and makes them easier to handle. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauces.

## Tips for the Crispiest Air Fryer Chicken Nuggets

Want to take your **frozen chicken nuggets air fryer** game to the next level? These tips will ensure maximum crunch and flavor:

- **Don’t Overcrowd**: Space out the nuggets to allow hot air to circulate evenly. Overlapping leads to steaming instead of crisping.[](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-make-super-easy-air-fryer-chicken-nuggets/)
- **Light Oil Spray (Optional)**: For extra crispiness, lightly spray the nuggets with cooking spray before cooking. This is optional, as most frozen nuggets already contain enough oil in the breading.[](https://40aprons.com/air-fryer-frozen-chicken-nuggets/)
- **Shake or Flip**: Give the basket a gentle shake or flip the nuggets halfway through cooking to ensure all sides get crispy. If using a solid tray, flipping is a must.[](https://myminichefs.com/air-fryer-frozen-chicken-nuggets/)
- **Adjust for Your Air Fryer**: Basket-style air fryers (like the Chefman) may cook faster than oven-style models. Start checking for doneness early to avoid overcooking.[](https://40aprons.com/air-fryer-frozen-chicken-nuggets/)
- **Experiment with Brands**: Try different brands like Tyson Dino Nuggets or Just Bare to find your favorite. Each may require slight time adjustments.[](https://airfryerdiaries.com/frozen-chicken-nuggets-air-fryer/)

Avoid the microwave for reheating, as it can make the nuggets soggy. The air fryer restores that fresh-from-the-freezer crunch.
