## What Is Spaghetti Squash?

Spaghetti squash is a yellow, oval-shaped winter squash known for its stringy, noodle-like flesh. When cooked, the interior naturally separates into strands resembling spaghetti, making it a popular choice for those seeking **low-carb pasta alternatives**. It’s packed with nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants, all while being low in calories (about 42 calories per cup).

This squash is a staple in **healthy air fryer meals** because it’s filling, versatile, and absorbs flavors beautifully. Plus, it’s naturally gluten-free, keto-friendly, and paleo-friendly, catering to a wide range of dietary needs.

## How to Choose the Perfect Spaghetti Squash

Before diving into **air fryer spaghetti squash** recipes, start with a quality squash. Here’s how to pick the best one:

- **Look for Firmness**: Choose a squash that feels heavy for its size with no soft spots or cracks.
- **Check the Color**: A ripe spaghetti squash is bright yellow. Avoid green or pale ones, as they’re underripe.
- **Size Matters**: A medium squash (2-3 pounds) is ideal for most air fryers. Larger ones may need to be cooked in batches.
- **Smooth Skin**: Avoid squash with blemishes or rough patches for the best texture.

Pro tip: If you’re unsure about ripeness, give it a gentle tap. A ripe squash sounds hollow.

## Preparing Spaghetti Squash for the Air Fryer

Proper prep is key to perfect **air fryer spaghetti squash**. Follow these steps to get your squash ready:

1. **Wash the Squash**: Rinse under cold water to remove dirt or debris.
2. **Cut Carefully**: Use a sharp knife to slice the squash in half lengthwise. This can be tough, so use a stable cutting board and consider microwaving the squash for 2-3 minutes to soften it slightly.
3. **Scoop Out Seeds**: Use a spoon to remove the seeds and stringy bits from the center. Save the seeds for roasting—they’re a tasty snack!
4. **Season Lightly**: Brush the cut sides with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper for basic seasoning.
