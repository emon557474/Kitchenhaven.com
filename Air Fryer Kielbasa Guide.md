## How to Cook Air Fryer Kielbasa: Step-by-Step Guide

Cooking **kielbasa in an air fryer** is incredibly simple, whether you’re preparing whole sausages or sliced bites. Follow these steps for perfect results every time.

### Step 1: Prepare the Kielbasa

- **Whole Kielbasa**: If using a whole sausage, pierce it with a fork in a few places to prevent bursting. This allows steam to escape while cooking.
- **Sliced Kielbasa**: For bite-sized pieces, slice the sausage into ½-inch rounds. This is great for snacks or appetizers.
- **Seasoning (Optional)**: While kielbasa is flavorful on its own, you can toss sliced pieces with a touch of olive oil, garlic powder, or paprika for extra flair.

### Step 2: Preheat the Air Fryer

- Set your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). Preheating ensures even cooking and a crispy exterior.
- Most air fryers take 3-5 minutes to preheat, depending on the model.

### Step 3: Arrange in the Air Fryer

- Place the kielbasa in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to allow proper air circulation.
- For whole sausages, you may need to cut them into smaller pieces to fit, depending on your air fryer’s size.

### Step 4: Cook the Kielbasa

- **Whole Kielbasa**: Air fry for 7-8 minutes, flipping halfway through to ensure even browning.
- **Sliced Kielbasa**: Cook for 5-7 minutes, shaking the basket halfway to promote even cooking.
- Check for an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C) to ensure the sausage is fully heated.

### Step 5: Serve and Enjoy

- Remove the kielbasa from the air fryer and let it rest for 1-2 minutes.
- Serve hot as a main dish, appetizer, or ingredient in other recipes (more on that below).
