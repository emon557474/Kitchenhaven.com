## Ingredients for Air Fryer Tortilla Chips

To make delicious **homemade tortilla chips in an air fryer**, you‚Äôll need just a few simple ingredients. Here‚Äôs what to gather:

- **Corn Tortillas**: Opt for 6-inch corn tortillas for the best chip size. Yellow or white corn tortillas both work well.

- **Salt**: Kosher or sea salt enhances flavor without overpowering.
- **Optional Seasonings**: Chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, or lime zest for custom flavors.

### Choosing the Right Tortillas

The foundation of great tortilla chips is high-quality tortillas. Here‚Äôs what to look for:

- **Freshness**: Fresh tortillas yield crispier chips. Check the expiration date or make your own if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Make Tortilla Chips in Air Fryer

Ready to create your own batch of crispy tortilla chips? Follow these easy steps for perfect results every time.

### Step 1: Prepare the Tortillas

1. **Cut the Tortillas**: Stack 4-6 corn tortillas and use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to slice them into wedges. Aim for 6-8 triangles per tortilla for chip-sized pieces.
2. **Season Lightly**: Place the wedges in a large bowl and lightly drizzle with oil (about 1-2 teaspoons per 4 tortillas). Toss to coat evenly. Sprinkle with salt and any desired seasonings.

### Step 2: Preheat the Air Fryer

- Set your air fryer to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Preheating ensures even cooking and maximum crispiness.
- If your air fryer doesn‚Äôt have a preheat function, let it run empty for 2-3 minutes at the desired temperature.

### Step 3: Arrange the Chips

- Place the tortilla wedges in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to ensure even cooking.
- Depending on your air fryer‚Äôs size, you may need to cook in batches. Overlapping chips can lead to uneven crispiness.

### Step 4: Air Fry the Chips

- Cook at 350¬∞F for 6-8 minutes, shaking the basket or flipping the chips halfway through to ensure even browning.
- Check for doneness: Chips should be golden and crispy. If needed, cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.

### Step 5: Cool and Season

- Transfer the chips to a wire rack to cool slightly. They‚Äôll crisp up further as they cool.
- Add extra seasonings while warm for better adhesion, if desired.
