## What Are Country Style Ribs?

Country-style ribs aren’t your typical ribs. Unlike spare ribs or baby back ribs, these are cut from the pork shoulder (or butt) near the blade, making them meatier and less bony. They’re packed with flavor and ideal for air frying due to their thickness and marbling. When cooked properly, they become tender, juicy, and perfect for soaking up your favorite seasonings or BBQ sauce.

### Why Use an Air Fryer for Country Style Ribs?

Air fryers are a game-changer for cooking **country style ribs in air fryer**. Here’s why:

## Step-by-Step Recipe for Country Style Ribs in Air Fryer

### Step 1: Prepare the Ribs

1. **Bring Ribs to Room Temperature**: Remove the ribs from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to ensure even cooking.[](https://airfryerfanatics.com/air-fryer-country-style-ribs/)
2. **Pat Dry**: Use paper towels to pat the ribs dry. This helps the seasoning stick and promotes a crispy exterior.
3. **Trim Excess Fat**: If needed, trim any large pieces of fat to prevent flare-ups in the air fryer.

### Step 2: Season the Ribs

1. In a small bowl, mix the smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).
2. Rub the ribs with olive oil, then coat them evenly with the spice mix. Make sure every inch is covered for maximum flavor.
3. Let the seasoned ribs sit for 10–15 minutes to absorb the flavors.

### Step 3: Preheat the Air Fryer

- Set your air fryer to 370°F (188°C) and preheat for 3–5 minutes. Preheating ensures even cooking and a nice sear.[](https://www.thefoodhussy.com/country-style-ribs-in-an-air-fryer/)
