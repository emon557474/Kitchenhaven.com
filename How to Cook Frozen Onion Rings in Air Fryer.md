## Step-by-Step Guide to Cooking Frozen Onion Rings in an Air Fryer

Ready to make those **crispy air fryer onion rings**? Follow these simple steps for perfect results every time.

### Step 1: Preheat Your Air Fryer
- Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C). Preheating ensures even cooking and maximum crispiness.
- Most air fryers take 3-5 minutes to preheat. If your model doesn’t have a preheat function, let it run empty for a few minutes.

### Step 2: Arrange the Onion Rings
- Place the frozen onion rings in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to allow proper air circulation.
- If needed, cook in batches to prevent overlapping, which can lead to soggy results.

### Step 3: Cook the Onion Rings
- Cook at 400°F for 6-8 minutes, shaking the basket or flipping the rings halfway through for even cooking.
- Check for your desired level of crispiness. If you prefer extra crunch, add 1-2 minutes, but keep an eye out to avoid burning.

### Step 4: Serve Immediately
- Remove the onion rings from the air fryer and season lightly with salt, if desired.
- Serve with your favorite dipping sauces like ketchup, ranch, or spicy mayo for extra flavor.
