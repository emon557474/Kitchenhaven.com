Cooking **chicken sausage in air fryer** is straightforward, but a few tips can ensure perfect results. Follow this simple guide for juicy, flavorful sausages every time.

### Ingredients
- Chicken sausages (pre-cooked or raw, your choice)
- Optional: A light spray of olive oil for extra crispiness
- Optional: Seasonings like black pepper, garlic powder, or paprika

### Equipment
- Air fryer (any model works, but a basket-style is common)
- Tongs for flipping
- Meat thermometer (optional, for checking doneness)

### Instructions
1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set your air fryer to 360°F (182°C) and let it preheat for 3-5 minutes. Preheating ensures even cooking.
2. **Prepare the Sausages**: If using raw sausages, prick them with a fork to prevent bursting. For pre-cooked sausages, this step is optional.
3. **Arrange in the Basket**: Place the sausages in a single layer, ensuring they don’t overlap. This allows hot air to circulate evenly.
4. **Cook**: 
   - **Pre-cooked sausages**: Air fry for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through.
   - **Raw sausages**: Air fry for 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
5. **Check Doneness**: Use a meat thermometer to confirm raw sausages are fully cooked. The exterior should be golden and slightly crispy.
6. **Serve**: Let the sausages rest for 1-2 minutes before serving to lock in juices.

### Pro Tip
For extra flavor, lightly spray the sausages with olive oil or toss them in a marinade before cooking. This enhances the crispiness and adds a flavor boost.

## Best Air Fryer Settings for Chicken Sausage

Finding the right temperature and time is key to perfectly cooked **air fryer chicken sausage**. Here are some guidelines:

- **Temperature**: 360°F (182°C) is ideal for most chicken sausages. Higher temperatures (up to 400°F) can work for a crispier exterior but may dry out the sausage.

  - Pre-cooked: 8-10 minutes
  - Raw: 10-15 minutes
- **Flipping**: Always flip halfway through to ensure even cooking.
- **Batch Size**: Avoid overcrowding the basket to maintain consistent results.
