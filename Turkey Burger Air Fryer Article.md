## Ingredients for the Perfect Air Fryer Turkey Burger

To make a delicious **turkey burger air fryer** recipe, start with quality ingredients. Here’s what you’ll need for four servings:

- **1 lb ground turkey** (93% lean is ideal for juiciness)
- **1 egg** (helps bind the patties)
- **1/4 cup breadcrumbs** (panko or regular work well)
- **1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce** (for umami flavor)
- **1 tsp garlic powder**
- **1 tsp onion powder**
- **1/2 tsp smoked paprika** (optional for a smoky kick)
- **Salt and pepper** to taste
- **Burger buns** (whole wheat, brioche, or lettuce wraps for a low-carb option)
- **Toppings**: Lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado, cheese, or your favorites
- **Condiments**: Ketchup, mustard, mayo, or a special sauce

### Optional Add-Ins for Extra Flavor
- **Fresh herbs**: Parsley or cilantro for a fresh touch.
- **Spices**: Chili powder or cumin for a spicy twist.
- **Cheese**: Mix in shredded cheddar or feta for a cheesy burger.

## Step-by-Step Air Fryer Turkey Burger Recipe

Ready to make the ultimate **healthy turkey burger**? Follow these simple steps for a foolproof **air fryer turkey burger recipe**:

### Step 1: Prepare the Patties
1. In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, egg, breadcrumbs, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.
2. Mix gently with your hands or a spoon until just combined—overmixing can make the burgers tough.
3. Divide the mixture into four equal portions and shape into patties about 1/2-inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center to prevent puffing during cooking.

### Step 2: Preheat the Air Fryer
- Set your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). Most modern air fryers preheat in 2-3 minutes, but check your model’s instructions.
- Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray to prevent sticking (optional, as turkey is lean).

### Step 3: Cook the Turkey Burgers
1. Place the patties in the air fryer basket in a single layer, ensuring they don’t touch.
2. Cook at 375°F for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C) for safe consumption.
3. If adding cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking.

### Step 4: Assemble and Serve
- Toast your buns (optional) and layer with your favorite toppings and condiments.
- Serve immediately with sides like sweet potato fries, a side salad, or air-fried veggies.

For the best air frying experience, a reliable air fryer makes all the difference. <h1 style="font-size: 80px;">
