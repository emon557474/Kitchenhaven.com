## How to Use Your Pampered Chef Air Fryer

Getting started with your **Pampered Chef Air Fryer** is simple, even if you’re new to air frying. Follow these steps to achieve delicious results every time:

### Step 1: Preheat the Air Fryer

Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking. Set the desired temperature (typically 350°F–400°F) and let it run for 3–5 minutes. Preheating is especially important for **air fryer recipes** that require a crispy texture, like French fries or chicken wings.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Ingredients

Cut food into uniform pieces to ensure even cooking. Lightly coat ingredients with oil (if needed) for extra crispiness. Avoid overcrowding the basket to allow proper air circulation.

### Step 3: Select the Right Settings

The **Pampered Chef Deluxe Air Fryer** offers presets for popular dishes like fries, wings, and vegetables. For custom recipes, use the temperature up and down buttons to adjust the heat. For example:
- **Crispy Foods**: Set to 400°F (e.g., fries, wings).
- **Tender Foods**: Use 350°F (e.g., fish, pastries).

### Step 4: Monitor and Flip

Most recipes require shaking or flipping the food halfway through cooking to ensure even browning. The air fryer’s digital timer makes this easy to track.

### Step 5: Clean Up

After cooking, let the air fryer cool down. Remove the basket and mess tray, which are dishwasher-safe or easy to clean with warm, soapy water. Regular cleaning ensures optimal performance and prevents grease buildup.
