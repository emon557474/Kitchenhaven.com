## <h2>Taste and Flavor</h2>

### <h3>French Press</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rich and full-bodied:</strong> The French press allows coffee grounds to steep in hot water, extracting more oils and flavors.</li>
<li><strong>No paper filter:</strong> This method preserves essential coffee oils, leading to a more robust taste.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable strength:</strong> You control the brewing time and coffee-to-water ratio.</li>
</ul>

### <h3>Coffee Maker</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smoother and lighter:</strong> Drip coffee makers use paper filters that absorb oils, resulting in a cleaner cup.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent taste:</strong> The automated process ensures the same flavor every time.</li>
<li><strong>Less sediment:</strong> Unlike the French press, it doesn’t leave tiny coffee particles in your cup.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Brewing Time</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>French Press:</strong> Takes about 4-5 minutes, plus grinding and boiling time.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee Maker:</strong> Usually takes 5-10 minutes, depending on the machine and brew size.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Convenience</h2>

### <h3>French Press</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires manual effort to boil water and press the plunger.</li>
<li>Best for people who enjoy the coffee-making process.</li>
<li>Portable and doesn’t require electricity.</li>
</ul>

### <h3>Coffee Maker</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fully automated—just add coffee and water.</li>
<li>Great for busy mornings and multiple servings.</li>
<li>Often comes with a timer and auto shut-off.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Maintenance and Cleaning</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>French Press:</strong> Needs to be disassembled and washed after each use.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee Maker:</strong> Requires regular cleaning, including the carafe, filter, and water reservoir.</li>
</ul>
