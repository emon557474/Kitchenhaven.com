<h2>What is an Electric Oven?</h2>
<p>An <strong>Electric Oven</strong> uses heating elements to generate heat for baking, roasting, and broiling.</p>

<h3>Pros of an Electric Oven:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Even Heating:</strong> Provides consistent temperatures for baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Dry Heat:</strong> Ideal for crisping and roasting food.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy to Install:</strong> Only requires a power outlet.</li>
    <li><strong>More Advanced Features:</strong> Includes convection, self-cleaning, and digital controls.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons of an Electric Oven:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Slower Heating:</strong> Takes longer to preheat than gas ovens.</li>
    <li><strong>Higher Energy Costs:</strong> Electricity is often more expensive than gas.</li>
    <li><strong>Not as Responsive:</strong> Takes longer to adjust temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a Gas Oven?</h2>
<p>A <strong>Gas Oven</strong> uses an open flame to generate heat for cooking and baking.</p>

<h3>Pros of a Gas Oven:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Instant Heat:</strong> Preheats faster than an electric oven.</li>
    <li><strong>Lower Operating Cost:</strong> Gas is generally cheaper than electricity.</li>
    <li><strong>Moist Heat:</strong> Keeps baked goods from drying out.</li>
    <li><strong>Better Temperature Control:</strong> Adjusts heat levels more quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons of a Gas Oven:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Uneven Heating:</strong> Hot spots can occur, affecting baking consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Requires Gas Line:</strong> Needs professional installation.</li>
    <li><strong>More Maintenance:</strong> Needs regular cleaning of burners and vents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
<h3>Choose an Electric Oven if:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You bake frequently and need even heating.</li>
    <li>You prefer an easy-to-install and low-maintenance appliance.</li>
    <li>You want modern features like digital controls and convection settings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Choose a Gas Oven if:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You need fast preheating and better temperature control.</li>
    <li>You want to save on energy costs with a gas-powered appliance.</li>
    <li>You prefer moist heat for baking bread and cooking meats.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>
<p>If you prioritize even heating, modern features, and ease of use, an <strong>Electric Oven</strong> is the best option. However, if you want quick heating, lower energy costs, and better temperature control, a <strong>Gas Oven</strong> is the better choice.</p>
