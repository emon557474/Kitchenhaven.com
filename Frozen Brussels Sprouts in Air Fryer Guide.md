## How to Cook Frozen Brussels Sprouts in an Air Fryer

Cooking **frozen Brussels sprouts in an air fryer** is simple, but a few tips can ensure perfect results. Follow this step-by-step guide:

### Ingredients
- 1 bag (12–16 oz) frozen Brussels sprouts
- 1–2 tbsp olive oil (or avocado oil)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- Optional: garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or balsamic vinegar

### Equipment
- Air fryer (we recommend a high-quality model for even cooking)
- Tongs or a spatula
- Mixing bowl

### Instructions
1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and let it preheat for 3–5 minutes. Preheating ensures even cooking.

3. **Arrange in the Air Fryer**: Place the Brussels sprouts in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to ensure crispiness.
4. **Cook**: Air fry for 12–18 minutes, shaking the basket or tossing the sprouts halfway through to promote even cooking. They’re done when the edges are golden and crispy.
5. **Check for Doneness**: If they’re not crispy enough, cook for an additional 2–3 minutes. Larger sprouts may need slightly longer.
6. **Serve**: Transfer to a plate and serve immediately. Add a drizzle of balsamic glaze or a sprinkle of Parmesan for extra flavor.
