### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set your air fryer to 400¬∞F and preheat for 3-5 minutes. Preheating helps achieve even cooking and maximum crispiness.[](https://watchlearneat.com/air-fryer-frozen-sweet-potato-fries/)

2. **Prepare the Fries**: Remove the Alexia sweet potato fries from the freezer. There‚Äôs no need to thaw‚Äîcook them straight from frozen for the best texture.

3. **Lightly Oil the Basket**: Spritz the air fryer basket with a non-aerosol oil spray to prevent sticking. Avoid using aerosol sprays, as they can damage the air fryer‚Äôs nonstick coating.

4. **Arrange the Fries**: Place the fries in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to ensure proper air circulation. If you‚Äôre cooking a full 20 oz bag, you may need to work in batches, especially with smaller air fryers (e.g., 5.5 qt models).[](https://watchlearneat.com/air-fryer-frozen-sweet-potato-fries/)

5. **Cook the Fries**: Air fry at 400¬∞F for 12-20 minutes, depending on your desired crispiness. Shake the basket or toss the fries with a silicone spatula every 4-5 minutes to promote even cooking. For extra crispy fries, spritz with a bit more oil halfway through.[](https://airfried.com/frozen-sweet-potato-fries-air-fryer-recipe/)

6. **Check for Doneness**: Use a kitchen thermometer to ensure the fries reach an internal temperature of 165¬∞F for food safety.[](https://us.amazon.com/Alexia-Potato-Crinkle-Pepper-Frozen/dp/B003UWNJT4)
