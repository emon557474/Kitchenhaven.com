## How to Cook Frozen Broccoli in an Air Fryer: Step-by-Step Guide

Cooking **frozen broccoli in an air fryer** is incredibly simple, but a few key tips can elevate your results from good to phenomenal. Follow these steps for perfectly crispy broccoli every time.

### Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients

You don‚Äôt need much to make **air fryer frozen broccoli** shine. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:

- **Frozen Broccoli Florets**: Opt for florets rather than ‚Äúbroccoli cuts‚Äù to avoid too many stems. A 14-16 oz bag works well for a 6-quart air fryer.[](https://iheartumami.com/frozen-broccoli-in-air-fryer/)
- **Olive Oil or Avocado Oil**: A light drizzle (1-2 tablespoons) helps the broccoli crisp up and allows seasonings to stick.
- **Basic Seasonings**: Salt, black pepper, and garlic powder are a classic trio.
- **Optional Add-Ins**: Lemon juice, parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, or other spices for extra flavor.

### Step 2: Preheat the Air Fryer

Preheating your air fryer ensures even cooking and maximum crispiness. Set it to **380-400¬∞F (190-204¬∞C)** for 4-5 minutes. If your air fryer doesn‚Äôt have a preheat function, just run it empty for a few minutes.[](https://beatthebudget.com/recipe/frozen-broccoli-in-airfryer/)

### Step 3: Season the Broccoli

Place the **frozen broccoli** in a large mixing bowl. Do **not** thaw it‚Äîthis is key to avoiding soggy results. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Toss to coat evenly. For extra flavor, consider these seasoning ideas:

- **Italian Twist**: Add Italian seasoning and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.
- **Spicy Kick**: Use chili powder, cayenne, or smoked paprika.
- **Asian-Inspired**: Toss with soy sauce and a pinch of ginger powder, then finish with sesame seeds.[](https://twosleevers.com/sesame-ginger-broccoli/)

### Step 4: Arrange in the Air Fryer

Spread the seasoned broccoli in a **single layer** in the air fryer basket. Overcrowding can cause the broccoli to steam rather than crisp, so cook in batches if necessary. If your broccoli includes tiny florets, set them aside to add halfway through cooking to prevent burning.[](https://theskinnyishdish.com/air-fryer-frozen-broccoli/)

### Step 5: Air Fry to Perfection

Cook the broccoli at **380-400¬∞F** for **8-12 minutes**, shaking the basket or tossing with tongs halfway through to ensure even cooking. Check for doneness‚Äîlook for golden-brown, crispy edges and tender stalks. If you prefer softer broccoli, cook for a shorter time; for extra crispiness, add a minute or two.[](https://mattsfitchef.com/frozen-broccoli-in-air-fryer/)

### Step 6: Add Finishing Touches

Once cooked, transfer the broccoli to a serving dish. For a burst of flavor, drizzle with lemon juice, sprinkle with parmesan cheese, or add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Serve immediately for the best texture.
