- **1 teaspoon garlic powder**
- **1 teaspoon onion powder**

## Step-by-Step Guide to Making Turkey Burgers in Air Fryer

Follow these simple steps to create mouthwatering **air fryer turkey burgers**:

### Step 1: Prepare the Turkey Mixture
1. In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, egg, breadcrumbs, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
2. Mix gently with your hands or a spatula until just combined. Overmixing can make the burgers tough.

2. If your air fryer basket isn’t nonstick, lightly spray it with cooking spray to prevent sticking.

### Step 3: Cook the Turkey Burgers
1. Place the patties in the air fryer basket in a single layer, ensuring they don’t overlap.
2. Cook at 375°F for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C) for safety.
3. For cheeseburgers, add a slice of cheese during the last minute of cooking.

### Step 4: Serve and Enjoy
1. Remove the burgers from the air fryer and let them rest for 2-3 minutes.
2. Serve on buns with your favorite toppings like lettuce, tomato, avocado, or a dollop of **air fryer turkey burger sauce** (more on that later!).

For the best results, invest in a quality air fryer to make cooking effortless.
