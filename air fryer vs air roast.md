## <h2>Cooking Method</h2>

### <h3>Air Fryer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid hot air circulation:</strong> Cooks food by crisping the exterior while keeping the inside tender.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal oil usage:</strong> Requires little to no oil, making it a healthier option.</li>
<li><strong>Ideal for crisping:</strong> Best for foods like fries, nuggets, and wings.</li>
</ul>

### <h3>Air Roast</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even hot air distribution:</strong> Uses convection-style cooking to roast food evenly.</li>
<li><strong>Better for larger meals:</strong> Suitable for roasting meats, vegetables, and whole chickens.</li>
<li><strong>Less crispy texture:</strong> Produces a tender interior but not as crispy as air frying.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Health and Nutrition</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Air Fryer:</strong> Uses significantly less oil than traditional frying, reducing fat intake.</li>
<li><strong>Air Roast:</strong> Retains more natural moisture, preserving nutrients in meats and vegetables.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Cooking Performance</h2>

### <h3>Air Fryer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great for achieving a crispy texture.</li>
<li>Works best with pre-cut or small-sized food items.</li>
<li>Shorter cooking times due to high-speed air circulation.</li>
</ul>

### <h3>Air Roast</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ideal for roasting meats, vegetables, and casseroles.</li>
<li>Provides even browning but without extreme crispiness.</li>
<li>Takes slightly longer cooking time than an air fryer.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Versatility</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Air Fryer:</strong> Best for quick snacks and small meals.</li>
<li><strong>Air Roast:</strong> Great for full meals and large portions.</li>
</ul>
