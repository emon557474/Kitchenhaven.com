They’re seasoned with spices like nutmeg, caraway, and pepper, giving them a distinctive, savory flavor. Brats are a popular choice for barbecues, tailgates, and casual meals, often served with mustard, sauerkraut, or grilled onions.

When air frying brats, you can use fresh, frozen, or pre-cooked varieties. Each type requires slightly different cooking times and techniques, which we’ll cover below.

## Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Brats

To ensure your brats come out juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked, follow these expert tips:
